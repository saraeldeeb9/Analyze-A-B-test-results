# Analyze-A-B-test-results
For this project, you will be working to understand the results of an A/B test run by an e-commerce website. The company has developed a new web page in order to try and increase the number of users who "convert," meaning the number of users who decide to pay for the company's product. Your goal is to work through this notebook to help the company understand if they should implement this new page, keep the old page, or perhaps run the experiment longer to make their decision.
Summary
This is an A/B testing assignment completed for Udacity's Data Analyst Nano Degree Program. The project consisted of understanding the results of an A/B test run by an e-commerce website and helping the company understand through statistical conclusions, if they should implement the new page, keep the old page, or perhaps run the experiment longer to make their decision.

Objectives
practice working on A/B testing projects and their practical difficulties
perform A/B tests and make recommendations backed by computed inferences
Project Steps & Research Questions:
Data Wrangling:
remove duplicates or records with missing or mismatched values
handle the rows where the landing_page and group columns don't align
Data Analytics:
Compute probabilities of converting:
regardless of page.
Given that an individual received the treatment
Given that an individual received the control page
Perform Hypothesis Testing and calculate p-values
Conduct Logistic Regression
